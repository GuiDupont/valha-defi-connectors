## Why integrate on Valha?

### Protocols 🏗️🏗️🏗️

As a DeFi protocol, you can leverage your exposure to third-party distributors (wallets, dapps, investment platforms) by standardizing the access to your pools. It will reduce the time needed by these actors to integrate you whoever you are and therefore help you grow your number of users and TVL.

### DeFi Apps 💻💻💻

As a DeFi app (wallets, dapps, yield aggregators), you can easily integrate new DeFi protocols by exploring the connectors made by protocols. By integrating the DeFi ecosystem directly in your interface, users won't have to hop from interface to interface. It will improve their experience and reduce their probability of being hacked.

<br>

## Integration Explanation

To integrate a DeFi protocol, one needs to know what are the related pools, to know the current main statistics of the pools and to know how to interact with such pools.
Therefore, in the integration process, we have three main following parts that end up in three folders: Pools, Analytics & Interactions.

### Pools

In this folder, there will have a main function returning all the current pools related to the protocol (and the associated information) by developing functions to get all the pools related to the protocol.

### Analytics

In this folder, there will have a main function returning all analytics about a specific pool by developing functions to get all the statictis related to one pool of the protocol.

### Interaction

In this folder, there will have a main function returning all the information necessarty to interact with specific pool by developing functions to know how to make specific actions on a pool.

## Getting Started

To integrate a DeFi protocol to Valha, you have to follow the next few steps!

### Prerequisites

<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank"> Node (>16)</a>

  <!-- <br> or <br>
<!-- - <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" target="_blank"> Docker </a> -->

### Add a new protocol 🚀

<h3>0. Make sure you have Node installed </h3>

```bash
node -v
```

<br />
<h3>1. Fork this repository </h3>

Click on the "Fork" button on the top right-hand corner of your screen.

<br />
<h3>2. Run "npm install" to install all the dependencies </h3>

```bash
npm install
```

<br />
<h3>3. Create a new folder in the folder SRC/CONNECTORS with your PROTOCOL_NAME and a folder with PRODUCT/VERSION of this integration </h3>

```bash
npm run create-connector -- --connector="protocol_name/product_version"
```

Your connector folder must respect the following structure to pass tests:

```bash
├── connectors
│ ├── name_of_your_protocol
│ │ ├── product_version_1
│ │ │  ├── abi
│ │ │  │  ├── Pool.json
│ │ │  │  ├── LP.json
│ │ │  ├── analytics
│ │ │  │  ├── index.js/ts
│ │ │  ├── interactions
│ │ │  │  ├── index.js/ts
│ │ │  ├── pools
│ │ │  │  ├── pools.js/ts
```

<br />
<h3>4. Develop your integration using JS or TS </h3>

🚨 Make sure your pools.js, analytics/index.js and interactions/index.js respect the expected EXPORT 🚨

🤞 Check in the `src/connectors` of the staging branch to check examples or read the INTERFACE section below

<h3>5. Make sure your integration works by running the TEST suites. </h3>

Test only your repository structure with:

```bash
npm run test-repository -- --connector="protocol_name/product_version"
```

Test only your analytics integration with:

```bash
npm run test-analytics -- --connector="protocol_name/product_version"
```

Test only your interaction integration with:

```bash
npm run test-interactions -- --connector="protocol_name/product_version"
```

Use the following command to run all the tests at once:

```bash
npm run full-test -- --connector="protocol_name/product_version"
```

🚨 If you have too many pools to test, you can make sure that your integration is working on a specific pool by using:

```bash
npm run full-test -- --connector="protocol_name/product_version" --pool="pool_address"
```

<br />
<h3> 6. Make your integration live by submitting a PR to the STAGING branch 🎉🎉🎉 </h3>

Keep in mind to "compare across forks" in the [pull request creation page](https://github.com/Valha-xyz/valha-defi-connectors/compare) to make your fork appears.

🚨🚨🚨 Make sure the TITLE of your PR is your "protocol_name/product_version" to pass CI/CD 🚨🚨🚨

<br />
<h3>7. Now, just enjoy as you make DeFi easier for everyone 🍹🍹🍹 </h3>

## Interface

<h3>Expected EXPORT for pools.js </h3>

```typescript
interface Pool {
  name: string; // Name of the pool.
  chain: string; // Chain on which the pool exists.
  underlying_tokens: string[]; // Addresses of the Tokens that are accepted by the pool.

```

<br />
<h3>Expected EXPORT for analytics/index.js </h3>

## ERC4626 Example

Let's consider that we are creating the connector for the v5 of the Valha protocol that call "valha/v5", we would run the following script to create the repositories:

```bash
npm run create-connector -- --connector="valha/v5"
```

### ABI - Example

We would add the ERC4626 ABI to a file name "erc4626.json" in the "valha/v5/abi/erc4626.json' repository.

### Analytics - Example

```javascript
/*
    DOCUMENTATION EXAMPLE to give more context about the integration work.

    Definitely need more testing and improvement.

    --> A CLI script will be developed to automatically generate ERC4626 connector
*/

const ERC4626ABI = require('../abi/ERC4626.json');
const { getNodeProvider } = require('src/utils/getNodeProvider');
const ethers = require('ethers');

async function getStatus(chain, pool_address) {
  return true;
}

async function getAPY(chain, pool_address) {
  const activity_apy = 2.5;
  const rewards_apy = 2.5;
  return { activity_apy: activity_apy, rewards_apy: rewards_apy };
}

async function getTotalAssets(POOL) {
  const decimals = await POOL.decimals();
  const TotalAssets = await POOL.totalAssets();
  return TotalAssets / 10 ** decimals;
}

async function getSharePrice(POOL) {
  const TotalAssets = await POOL.totalAssets();
  const TotalSupply = await POOL.totalSupply();
  return TotalAssets / TotalSupply;
}

async function analytics(chain, poolAddress) {
  const provider = await getNodeProvider(chain);
  if (!provider) throw new Error('No provider was found.');
  const POOL = new ethers.Contract(poolAddress, ERC4626ABI, provider);
  const TVL = await getTotalAssets(POOL);
  const status = await getStatus(POOL);
  const { activity_apy, rewards_apy } = await getAPY(chain, poolAddress);
  const sharePrice = await getSharePrice(chain, poolAddress);

  const result = {
    status: status,
    tvl: TVL,
    liquidity: TVL,
    outloans: null,
    losses: null,
    capacity: 10_000_000,
    apy: activity_apy + rewards_apy,
    activity_apy: activity_apy,
    rewards_apy: rewards_apy,
    boosting_apy: 0,
    share_price: sharePrice,
    minimum_deposit: null,
    maximum_deposit: null,
  };

  return result;
}

module.exports = {
  main: analytics,
  url: 'https://app.test.xyz',
};
```

## Advice

### Analytics 🔍

Try to always get information from the chain, not from an API. It will increase confidence in your protocol and simplify understanding for analysts.

### Interactions 🏎️

Try to get the interactions functions fast. It will improve the performance of apps using them.

## Acknowledgements 📚📚📚

<div>
  Valha's connectors and development philosophy are heavily inspired by the impressive work done by the <a href="https://defillama.com/" target="_blank"> DefiLlama </a> team, its community and the way the product has developed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We believe that open and collaborative contribution is one of the greatest catalysts for composability in decentralised finance. There are many ways to make the DeFi ecosystem more transparent, understandable and operable. We hope to make Valha part of this mission.
